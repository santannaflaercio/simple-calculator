## Operations

The calculator can perform the following operations:

1. **Addition (`add`)**: This operation adds two numbers together.
    - Example: `add(1, 2)` will return `3`.

2. **Subtraction (`subtract`)**: This operation subtracts the second number from the first.
    - Example: `subtract(5, 3)` will return `2`.

3. **Multiplication (`multiply`)**: This operation multiplies two numbers together.
    - Example: `multiply(2, 3)` will return `6`.

4. **Division (`divide`)**: This operation divides the first number by the second. If the second number is `0`, it will return an error message.
    - Example: `divide(10, 2)` will return `5`.
    - Example: `divide(10, 0)` will return `"Error! Division by zero is not allowed."`

## How to Run

To run the calculator, simply run the `calculator.py` script in Python. The program will prompt you to select an operation and input two numbers, then it will display the result.
